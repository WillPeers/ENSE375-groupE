# *Adding Collaborators* #

While working in group it is essential to have files that are in common to avoid file duplication and keeping track of work. Github Allows us to add collaborators in the repository such that everyone invited to the repository can manage the files and access the files as per their need. To add collaborator, open the repository you want to share >> go to `Settings` >> click on `Manage access` >> click on `invite a collaborator` >> enter the username you want to invite. That person has now been invited and the owner can also cancel the invite request.
